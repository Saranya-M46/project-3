This project provides a simple REST API for managing a list of books using Node.js and Express. It supports basic CRUD operations:
   Create a new book
   Read all or one book
   Update book details
   Delete a book
Data is stored in memory (no database), making it ideal for learning REST API development, backend basics, and integration testing with tools like Postman or curl.
